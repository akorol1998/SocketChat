# TODO delete all the hardcoded parts, which are trying to match  GUI look.
# Those are user nickname length restriction, minimum width for user`s Label
# in the chat window, inside the QformLayout

# TODO Fix the slot that is triggered by the VerticalScrollBar. It is meant to scroll the area down
# after each new message, But not when the window is changed. May be the solution is to use another signal.
